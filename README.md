# Rentkent-A Home far from Home

**Rentkent** is an early-stage startup. This platform helps people to find out affordable houses, Hostels, Rooms, and PGs in their desired city. This platform enhances the accessibility of various real estate entities to the peoples.


# Ideations

An idea was very simple to create **Better transparent platform** by replacing the current online platform. Mainly students face too many problems after staying for one month or two months in the private accommodation. also on another side new stranges in the respective city also face transparency issue with their house owners.

## Solution

To encounter this issue we planned to develop two applications using **Flutter cross-platform.** after four to five-month we made production-level applications.

## What's new
People/Students (mainly) get benefits from their respective accommodation booking through the platforms.

 1. Better transparency
 2. On per booking coupons of local shops/business using they can save their money.
 3. Realtime reviews from accomandation 
 4. Verified accomandations 

## Technology
For building and deploy this application we have used various techniques.While keeping in mind the cost and availability of various resources, we have used the following technologies for development purposes.

 1. Flutter - Mobile Application development
 2. Firebase-Cloud Firestore for storage,authentication and notification purpose
 3. Javascript and PHP - Dashboard (CMS) of the whole project
 4. Special API - GST API for hostel/properties owner authentication 
	
## Releases
This project is a combination of three applications. first application which enables all listed accommodation entities on the platform for end-user. The second one is built for hostel owner/PG owner. Third one for local businesses. (Feel free to mail us for more info)
